### Hello, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹


Here's what I am up to:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on keeping my skills fresh by working on small quality of life scripts to automate redundant and time-consuming tasks. 
- ðŸŒ± I plan on finding a data engineer role fairly soon, so Iâ€™m currently learning about new and useful Python libraries. I am also improving my SQL skills to one day become a data jedi.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about drones, sloths, cars, personal finance / FIRE, real estate.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I will often dive into deep rabbitholes about topics that interest me for months at a time. I am currently learning everything I can about DIY permaculture setups for urban environments. I am looking for a way to integrate coding into a home-built aquaponics system.
